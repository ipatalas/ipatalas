### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a... geek? :) Well.. I have a [customized console](https://github.com/ipatalas/ConEmu) so I think that counts :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my home automation (Home Assistant as a heart of the system) - to be published after I finish "refactoring".
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like regular expressions ðŸ˜‰ but use them in my code very rarely - I know the pain and confusion it causes for most of the people. Still it's a great tool even for ad hoc text processing.
- ðŸš§ I've built quite a few VS Code extensions. Not only it is easy to write them, but it's also a lot of fun and in the end you can easily increase your productivity. [Check](https://github.com/ipatalas?tab=repositories&q=vscode&type=&language=) them out!
- ðŸ’¡ I am a big fan and a licensed user of LINQPad - really great tool to put your ideas to a test. I no longer have ConsoleApplication45 and others on my disk :)
