### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a... geek? :)

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my home automation (Home Assistant as a heart of the system)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like regular expressions ğŸ˜‰ but use them in my code very rarely - I know the pain it causes. Still it's a great tool even outside programming world.
